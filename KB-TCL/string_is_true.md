# string is true

## Introduction

The `string is true` command in Tcl is used to check if a string represents a true value. It evaluates the string and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is considered true or not.

It's important to note that the `string is true` command checks for the specific string representations of true values in Tcl, such as "1", "true", "yes", "on", and "enabled". Any other string values will be considered false.


## Syntax

The syntax of the `string is true` command is as follows:

`string is true string`


- `string`: The string to be evaluated.


## Examples and Explanations

### Example 1: Checking a True Value


**Code:**
```
set value "true"

if {[string is true $value]} {
    puts "The value is true."
} else {
    puts "The value is not true."
}
```

**Output:**
```
The value is true.
```

In this example, the `value` variable contains the string `true`. The `string is true` command is used to evaluate the string and check if it represents a true value. Since "true" is considered a true value, the condition `[string is true $value]` evaluates to true, and the message `The value is true.`` is printed.


### Example 2: Checking a False Value


**Code:**
```
set value "false"

if {[string is true $value]} {
    puts "The value is true."
} else {
    puts "The value is not true."
}
```

**Output:**
```
The value is not true.
```

In this example, the `value` variable contains the string `false`. The `string is true` command is used to evaluate the string and check if it represents a true value. Since `false` is not considered a true value, the condition `[string is true $value]` evaluates to false, and the message `The value is not true.` is printed.

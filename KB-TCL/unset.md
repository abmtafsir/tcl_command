# unset

## Introduction:

The `unset` command in Tcl is used to delete variables, freeing the memory occupied by the variable and its value. When a variable is no longer needed, the `unset` command can be used to remove it from the namespace. 

## Syntax:


`unset ?-nocomplain? ?-nocomplainall? ?--? ?varName varName ...?`


- `-nocomplain`: (Optional) Prevents generating an error if the variable doesn't exist.
- `-nocomplainall`: (Optional) Prevents generating errors for non-existent variables within the list.
- `--`: (Optional) Indicates the end of options, allowing variable names to begin with hyphens.
- `varName varName ...`: The names of the variables to be unset.

## Examples and Explanations:

### Example 1: Deleting a Single Variable

**Code:**
``````
set name "Alice"
puts "Name before unset: $name"
unset name
puts "Name after unset: $name"
``````

**Output:**
``````
Name before unset: Alice
Name after unset:
``````

In this example, the variable `name` is created and assigned the value "Alice." The `unset` command is then used to delete the variable. After the `unset` command is executed, attempting to access the variable results in an empty value.

### Example 2: Deleting Multiple Variables

**Code:**
``````
set age 30
set city "New York"
puts "Age: $age, City: $city"
unset age city
puts "Age after unset: $age"
puts "City after unset: $city"
``````

**Output:**
``````
Age: 30, City: New York
Age after unset:
City after unset:
``````

In this example, the variables `age` and `city` are created and assigned values. The `unset` command is used to delete both variables. After deletion, attempting to access the variables results in empty values.

### Example 3: Using `-nocomplain` Option

**Code:**
``````
puts "Name before unset: $name"
unset -nocomplain name
puts "Name after unset: $name"
``````

**Output:**
``````
Name before unset:
Name after unset:
``````

In this example, the `-nocomplain` option is used with the `unset` command. This prevents an error from being generated if the variable `name` doesn't exist. As a result, the `unset` command has no effect on the variable.

### Example 4: Deleting Variables Using a List

**Code:**
``````
set variable_list {age city name}
puts "Variables before unset: $variable_list"
foreach var $variable_list {
    unset $var
}
puts "Variables after unset: $variable_list"
``````

**Output:**
``````
Variables before unset: age city name
Variables after unset:
``````

In this example, a list named `variable_list` contains the names of variables to be unset. The `foreach` loop iterates through the list and uses the `unset` command to delete each variable. After deletion, attempting to access the variables results in empty values.
